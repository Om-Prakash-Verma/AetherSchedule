            <WorkflowStep icon={Database} step="01" title="Building a Digital Blueprint">
                <p>Before we can build a house, we need a blueprint and all the right materials. The first step is to create a perfect digital reflection of your institution's resources and needs. This becomes the single source of truth for the entire system.</p>
                <div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4 mt-4">
                    <SubStepCard icon={BookOpen} title="Subjects">We define every course, its code, its type (a theory class has different needs than a practical lab), and crucially, how many hours it requires per week. The AI uses this to ensure every course gets the time it needs.</SubStepCard>
                    <SubStepCard icon={User} title="Faculty">Who can teach what? We map professors to their subject expertise. This prevents the AI from assigning a history professor to a calculus class. We also record their teaching preferences, a key ingredient for faculty satisfaction.</SubStepCard>
                    <SubStepCard icon={Building} title="Rooms">Every space is catalogedâ€”its name, its capacity, and its type. The AI understands that you can't hold a chemistry lab in a standard lecture hall or fit 100 students in a room built for 30.</SubStepCard>
                    <SubStepCard icon={School} title="Batches">We define every group of students, their department, semester, and the specific list of subjects they must take. This creates the "demand" side of the scheduling puzzle that the AI needs to solve.</SubStepCard>

            </WorkflowStep>

            <WorkflowStep icon={Lock} step="02" title="Defining the Rules of the Road">
                <p>Think of our AI like a GPS. You tell it the destination (a finished timetable), but you also have to tell it the rules of the road. Constraints are the essential boundaries that ensure every generated schedule is practical, fair, and physically possible.</p>
                 <div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4 mt-4">
                    <SubStepCard icon={UserCheck} title="Hard Constraints (The Unbreakables)">These are the laws of physics. A professor cannot be in two places at once. A room cannot host two classes simultaneously. The AI treats these rules as absolute and will never violate them.</SubStepCard>
                    <SubStepCard icon={CalendarDays} title="Soft Constraints (The Ideals)">These are goals, not laws. For example, "Students should have as few gaps in their day as possible" or "A professor's workload should be evenly distributed." The AI's main job is to get as close to these ideals as possible.</SubStepCard>

            <WorkflowStep icon={Cpu} step="03" title="The Magic of Intelligent Automation">
                <p>With the blueprint and rules in place, the human operator simply selects the student batches and clicks "Generate." This unleashes a powerful hyper-heuristic genetic algorithm, guided by Google's Gemini, that works like a team of a million schedulers exploring every possibility at once.</p>
                <GlassPanel className="p-6 mt-4 border border-[var(--accent)]/20">

                         <SubStepCard icon={Bot} title="The Game Plan">Before starting, Gemini creates a smart game plan. It decides to first explore a wide variety of solutions, then focus on improving the best ones it finds, and finally, apply a deep polish to the top contenders. This makes the process incredibly efficient.</SubStepCard>
                         <SubStepCard icon={Dna} title="Survival of the Fittest">The AI creates an initial "population" of hundreds of random (but valid) timetables. It then rapidly evolves them over thousands of generations. The best schedules "survive" and combine their traits to create even better offspring, while weak schedules are discarded.</SubStepCard>

                         <SubStepCard icon={BarChart4} title="The Judge">How does it know which is "best"? Every single timetable is given a fitness score. It loses points for undesirable traits (like a 4-hour gap for a student) and is rewarded for efficiency. The algorithm is obsessed with achieving the highest possible score.</SubStepCard>
                         <SubStepCard icon={Lightbulb} title="The Creative Spark">If the algorithm starts getting stuck on a good-but-not-great solution, Gemini steps in like an expert consultant. It analyzes the problem and provides a creative "nudge" to explore a completely new path, often leading to a breakthrough that evolution alone might have missed.</SubStepCard>

                <p>The AI does 99% of the heavy lifting, producing several near-perfect timetables in minutes. Now, human expertise provides the crucial final touch, turning an optimal solution into the perfect one for your institution's unique culture and needs.</p>

                    <SubStepCard icon={Pencil} title="Tweak with Confidence">See a class you want to move? Simply drag and drop it. The system acts as your intelligent assistant, instantly warning you if your manual change creates a conflict, so you can never make a mistake.</SubStepCard>
                    <SubStepCard icon={Send} title="Review & Approve">Share a final draft with department heads or other stakeholders. They can add comments directly on the platform, creating a clear, centralized feedback loop before the final version is approved and locked.</SubStepCard>
